## 💡 Key Business Insights

- **Strong overall performance with stable profitability**  
  From 2014 to 2018, Acme Co. generated approximately **$1B in total revenue** and **$462M in total profit**, maintaining a **stable profit margin around 37%**. This indicates effective cost control despite fluctuations in sales volume.

- **Clear and recurring seasonality in revenue**  
  Monthly revenue shows a consistent dip in **February (≈ $91M)**, followed by **stronger and more stable performance from April through December**, with multiple monthly peaks above **$105M**.

- **High product revenue concentration**  
  The **top 5 products account for 37% of total revenue**, indicating a strong dependency on a limited number of products and increasing exposure to product concentration risk.

- **Uneven value contribution across sales channels**  
  The **Wholesale channel generates the highest revenue ($0.67B)** but delivers lower profitability, while the **Export channel generates lower revenue ($0.18B)** with relatively higher margins.

- **Significant customer concentration risk**  
  A small number of customers contributes a substantial share of total revenue, with the **top 10 customers generating approximately $109M**, increasing dependency on key accounts.

- **Customer profitability varies significantly**  
  Several customers achieve **profit margins above 44%**, while some high-revenue customers operate at lower margins, highlighting opportunities for customer-level margin optimization.

## 🚀 Managerial Recommendations

- **Protect and optimize top-performing products**  
  Maintain pricing discipline and cost control on the highest revenue-generating products to preserve their contribution to overall profitability.

- **Optimize the sales channel mix**  
  Continue leveraging the Wholesale channel for volume while **selectively expanding the Export channel** to improve total profit margins.

- **Adopt differentiated customer strategies**  
  Prioritize retention of **high-margin customers** and reassess pricing or service conditions for high-volume but low-margin accounts.

- **Reduce concentration risk**  
  Gradually diversify both the product portfolio and customer base to reduce dependency on a limited number of key revenue drivers.
